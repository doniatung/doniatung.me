I tried to set up the branch part to establish the actual website through namecheap, but for some reason it is not working, so I'm just going to include instructions on running this locally. Sorry about that though! 

### Instructions on Running this App

  
Clone this repository by typing the following into your terminal window:
```
$ git clone <repo cloning link>
```
 
Then you can use Chrome to open the file "index.html" to view the website. 

Again, sorry I couldn't figure out what went wrong with the branching, but I thought my time would be better spent working on other problems.
